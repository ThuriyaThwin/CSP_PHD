= Selecting computations in sequential decision problems =

We look at problems in which a sequence of computational actions
must be performed to achieve a goal, and outcomes of earlier
actions affect selection of later actions. Examples of such
problems are parameter optimization, multi-armed bandits, and
combinatorial games. We introduce an approach to selecting
computations based on value of information and time cost of a
computation, and demonstrate application of the approach to
different domains. The work is based on the theory of rational
metareasoning.
