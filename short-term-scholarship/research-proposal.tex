Aspects of methodology of rational metareasoning initially
presented in the conference
publications~\cite{TolpinShimony.mcts,HayRussellTolpinShimony.selecting}
on VOI-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search and~\cite{tolpinetal.rla}
on rational deployment of heuristics in A* are, despite
significant theoretical and empirical results, just the first
steps in the exploration of the corresponding research fields.
Some important results had to be omitted due to inherent space
limitations of conference publications.  Additional work which
has been and being done in the above-mentioned research directions
justifies publication of extended journal versions of the papers
with new theoretical results and expanded empirical evaluations.  

In particular, the advances in the Monte Carlo Tree Search are based
on distribution-independent VOI bounds. The improved sampling
scheme was empirically evaluated on the domain of Computer Go.
Another domain where MCTS recently proved to be efficient is
online planning in Markov Decision Processes. Some
results for MCTS in MDP were obtained, but not yet published,
during the initial research.
