RLA: Todo - assumptions

\begin{itemize}
  \item Myopic assumption: this is the {\em last}
        meta-level decision to be made, and henceforth the algorithm
        will act like lazy $\astar$.
\item When a node re-emerges from the open list,
      compare the regret of computing $h_2$ as in lazy $\astar$, vs.
      just expanding the node.
\item Note: if rational lazy $\astar$ is indeed better than lazy
  $\astar$, the myopic assumption results in an upper bound
  on the regret.
\end{itemize}
