In this chapter three case studies of applications of rational
metareasoning are presented.

[three kinds of search problems]

[violation of assumptions]
Each of the case studies deals with
a problem in which straightforward application of rational
metareasoning faces difficulties because some of the assumptions
of the approach do not hold. 

[algorithm rather than problem set specific learning]
